DAY 1 - 11/14/24 - 1:30 PM - 3:30 PM

- Initialized C and CUDA files for Image Reading
- Selected a test image (glorp) and converted from png to jpeg to bmp
- Researched potential libraries to use in order to obtain RGB values of imported images
- Finalized plans and procedures - we will be applying greyscale filtering, and possibly more filters in the future (blurring, etc)

DAY 2 - 11/16/24 - 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM

- Worked on C image reader, specifically metadata checker, referencing a video by Nick Walton titled, "Load .BMP Images in C"

DAY 3 - 11/22/24 - 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM

- Worked on debugging C image reader, and planning ahead for further GPU development

DAY 4 - 11/14/24 - 4:00 PM - 6:00 PM

- Tested the CPU reader with various image sizes

- Ran into bug causing reader to seg fault at a certain stage of reading images -> usually in 90,000 mark

- Got RGB values to be accurately recorded and printed
