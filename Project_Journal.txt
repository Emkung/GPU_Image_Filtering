DAY 1 - 11/14/24 - 1:30 PM - 3:30 PM

- Initialized C and CUDA files for Image Reading
- Selected a test image (glorp) and converted from png to jpeg to bmp
- Researched potential libraries to use in order to obtain RGB values of imported images
- Finalized plans and procedures - we will be applying greyscale filtering, and possibly more filters in the future (blurring, etc)

DAY 2 - 11/16/24 - 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM

- Worked on C image reader, specifically metadata checker, referencing a video by Nick Walton titled, "Load .BMP Images in C"

DAY 3 - 11/22/24 - 11:00 AM - 12:00 PM

- Worked on debugging C image reader, and planning ahead for further GPU development
